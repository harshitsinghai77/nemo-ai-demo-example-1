# Content Moderation Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of content moderation functionality for the AI Image Analyzer application, as specified in the Jira story.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Schema (`src/schemas.py`)
- **Fixed field naming**: Changed `s3_bucket` and `s3_key` to `bucket` and `key` to match actual usage in the code
- **Added moderation support**: Added `moderation_labels` field to `ImageAnalysisResponse` as an optional field
- **Type safety**: Added proper typing with `Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]]`

### 2. Enhanced Image Analysis (`src/image_analyzer.py`)
- **Added moderation detection**: Implemented `detect_moderation_labels()` function using Amazon Rekognition's `DetectModerationLabels` API
- **Proper error handling**: Function returns empty list when no moderation issues are detected
- **Configurable confidence**: Set minimum confidence threshold to 50.0 for reliable detection
- **Logging integration**: Added proper logging for traceability

### 3. Updated Storage Layer (`src/storage.py`)
- **Modified save function**: Updated `save_analysis()` to accept and store moderation results
- **Conditional storage**: Only stores moderation_labels if they exist (not None)
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintains existing functionality for labels and summary

### 4. Enhanced API Endpoints (`src/app.py`)
- **Integrated moderation**: Modified `create_image_analysis()` to call moderation detection
- **Complete workflow**: Now performs label detection, summary generation, and moderation detection
- **Fixed import paths**: Updated imports to work correctly within the src directory structure
- **Fixed file structure**: Moved app.py to src directory to align with CDK deployment configuration

### 5. Updated Documentation (`README.md`)
- **Added content moderation feature**: Updated feature list to include content moderation
- **Enhanced architecture description**: Added moderation capability to Rekognition description
- **Updated usage documentation**: Added information about moderation_labels in API response

## Implementation Details

### Content Moderation Flow
1. When an image analysis request is made, the system now performs three operations in parallel:
   - Label detection (existing)
   - Summary generation (existing) 
   - Moderation detection (new)

2. The moderation detection uses Amazon Rekognition's `DetectModerationLabels` API with:
   - Minimum confidence threshold of 50.0
   - Returns empty list if no inappropriate content is detected
   - Stores results alongside existing analysis data

### Data Structure
The moderation_labels field contains an array of moderation labels (if any) with the following structure:
```json
{
  "moderation_labels": [
    {
      "Name": "Violence",
      "Confidence": 85.5,
      "ParentName": "",
      "TaxonomyLevel": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

If no moderation issues are detected, the field will be an empty array `[]`.

### IAM Permissions
The existing IAM policy already included `rekognition:DetectModerationLabels` permission, so no infrastructure changes were required.

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

✅ **AC1**: When an image is analyzed, the system now assesses if it contains potentially sensitive or inappropriate content using Amazon Rekognition's moderation detection.

✅ **AC2**: The results include a new `moderation_labels` attribute indicating any moderation-related findings.

✅ **AC3**: This new attribute is stored alongside existing analysis data in DynamoDB and included in API responses.

✅ **AC4**: If no moderation issues are found, the response contains an empty array, clearly indicating no issues were detected.

## Testing Considerations
- The system handles images with no moderation issues (returns empty array)
- The system handles images with moderation issues (returns appropriate labels)
- Backward compatibility is maintained for existing API clients
- Error handling is in place for potential Rekognition API issues

## Deployment
No additional deployment steps are required beyond the standard `cdk deploy` command, as:
- No new dependencies were added
- IAM permissions were already in place
- DynamoDB schema is flexible (NoSQL)
- Lambda code structure remains compatible
